      <h1>Our tools shape us</h1>

      <p>The way you think about solutions is altered by the tool you use</p>
      <br/>
      <p>When a tool does what is sufficient you might not look further</p>
      <p>.. leading to box thinking and limitation of your creativity</p>
      <br/>
      <p>Automation might even lead you to not question what you do</p>
